# mlaphp/mlaphp

This is a library package of code introduced throughout [Modernizing Legacy Applications in PHP](https://leanpub.com/mlaphp). It is mostly for transitional purposes as we improve the legacy codebase, although it does stand well on its own. It is PSR-0, PSR-1, and PSR-2 compliant. It has 100% test coverage, except for the _MysqlDatabase_ class which is provided only as an example.
